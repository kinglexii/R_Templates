Welcome to # R_Templates
- [Description](#description)
This is an open-source collection of templated R code snippets designed to streamline and simplify various aspects of the R workflow. As a community-driven project, MY goal is to provide a set of reusable templates that can be easily adapted to suit different projects and use cases.

## What's Inside:
* Templates: A curated selection of pre-written R codes for common tasks such as data cleaning, visualization, modeling, and more.
* Examples: Real-world scenarios showcasing how these templates can be applied in practice.
* Documentation: Detailed comments within each template explaining the logic behind the code.
